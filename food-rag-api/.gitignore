# Generated assets by the application (parquet, faiss index)
# These are often large and can be regenerated.
# They are typically placed in app/assets/ or persistent_assets/ via volume mounts.
# If you are committing pre-generated versions to app/assets for a base state,
# then don't ignore app/assets. If app/assets is purely for runtime generated files
# via volume mounts from persistent_assets, then you might ignore it.
# For this project, you likely *are* committing your initial .parquet and .faiss to app/assets.
# So, we will NOT ignore app/assets by default.
